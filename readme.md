A repository of scripts to run on my obsidian vault.

At the moment, only a script to turn daily media/work log notes into weeklies, 
or at least vague structures hinting at weeklies. However, the generic manner 
of these functions hint toward future goals.... Perhaps....

Much of the obsidian functions are stolen or adapted from rachsmithcodes'
wonderful [Obsidian to Astro Sync](https://github.com/rachsmithcodes/obsidian-to-astro-sync/tree/main)
